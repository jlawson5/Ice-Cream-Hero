<h2>Ice Cream Hero</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Follow the ice cream truck's trail of ice cream, but watch out for the evil spinach truck's cans of spinach!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players must collect ice cream to raise their time limit and gain as many points as possible within the time limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is an arcade style game simple enough for a kid to play, but allows for quick-thinking and skill as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The hero (a kid on a tricycle) can be controlled using the arrow keys. The player must collect items that were dropped on the road by the ice cream truck and (optionally) the spinach truck. Collecting ice cream will earn 2000 points and gives you more energy to continue on your perilous journey, adding 3 seconds to your time limit. Collecting gross canned spinach will give you 10000 points, because it is healthy, but tastes gross and will reduce your time limit by 10 seconds. Either an ice cream cone or a can of spinach will spawn in one of the three lanes about once a second. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
My goal for this game was to mess around with timers and time limits, as that is a concept I have not really dealt much with yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game has a time limit, but features the ability to continuously raise your time limit by collecting ice cream. This potentially allows for players to play for far past the original 60 second time limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You play a kid on a tricycle determined to get ice cream from the ice cream truck.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The player, a kid, hears the heavenly tune of the ice cream truck driving past the house. Your parents, of course, say you do not need ice cream and do not give you money. The player then grabs their tricycle and gives chase, determined to get some ice cream!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is aimed towards children (I am sure many children can relate to the above story, it's happened to me numerous times, minus the chasing the ice cream truck part)
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
as short or as long as the player makes it (by collecting spinach or ice cream to lower or raise their time limit)
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player may choose to aim only for ice cream to keep their time limit high, or if the player wants to quickly raise their score, they may choose to collect a balance of spinach (for higher points) and ice cream (to raise the time limit)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All sprites were made myself. Sound effects were taken from soundbible.com and are considered public domain.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game is similar to any vertically scrolling racing game. I did not use any phaser examples as a template; however, I did use my previous games for reference.
